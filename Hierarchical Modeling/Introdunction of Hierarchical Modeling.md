1. When should we use hierarchical models?
  
  When observations are not independent of each other given the prefictor variables.
  
  For example: cluster-level attributes: observations belong to different clusters and each cluster has its own properties (different response mean, different sensitivity to each predictor).
 
2. What is the difference between hierarchical model and generalized linear model?
    
    The GLM assume the observations are independent of each other given the predictor variables.
