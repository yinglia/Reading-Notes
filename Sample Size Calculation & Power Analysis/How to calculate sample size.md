p-value can be thought of as the probability of obtaining a test statistic as 
extreme as or more extreme than the actual test statistic obtained, given that the 
null hypothesis is true


Guidelines for Judging the Significance of a p-Value
If .01 ≤ p < .05, then the results are significant.
If .001 ≤ p < .01, then the results are highly significant.
If p < .001, then the results are very highly significant.
If p > .05, then the results are considered not statistically significant (sometimes 
denoted by NS).
However, if .05 ≤ p < .10, then a trend toward statistical significance is sometimes noted.
